# QUESTION 2 - ECOMMERCE CHECKOUT
You have been hired by H&M to develop an online E-Commerce Web Application. Using HTML 5 /CSS/Javascript, quickly create a checkout prototype page for H&Mâ€™s E-commerce store.

1. PART 1:  Develop the User Interface 

Your User Interface should look similar to the below diagram  


2. PART 2:  Calculating Extended Prices 

Clicking on the r+ / - buttons should increase/decrease the respective quantity & calculate the respective extended Price for pants and shirt, as shown in the below diagram shown. All amounts need to be rounded to 2 decimal points.



You cannot have negative quantities in the shopping cart. Thus, if the quantity is zero on any of the two items and the user hits the - button, the quantity should not decrease further.

Extended Price is Quantity X Extended Price


3. PART 3:  Calculating the SubTotal/Tax and Final Total of your shopping cart

When the user presses the CALCULATE button,  the web application should calculate subtotal (Add two extended prices together), tax (13% of the sub total), and total (subtotal + tax)l.  
These amounts must be output to the user interface, as shown in the diagram below.
All amounts should be rounded to 2 decimal points.




4. PART 4:  Adding Coupons 

When the user presses the Click to Enter button,  the web application should prompt the user to enter a coupon code from the below codes:

Code
Effect
NOTAX
Customer does not need to pay tax
FIFTYFIFTY
Customer gets 50% off their subtotal





Once the user enters a valid code, the calculated discount value should be deducted from final total and should be updated on the page
